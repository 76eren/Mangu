# MangaReader

An app I made for reaidng manga


Notes:
  - This is not the final version. I am still working on a bunch of things
  - I am no pro at android development (as you might have noticed)
  
  
Things I still need to do:
  - Allow user to go to a previous chapter
  - Make the images cache before starting to read
  - Go back to chapter list from the reading page
  - Change the current chapter list UI to a resycleview.
  - Cache images before loading chapter    


Done:
  - Add an interface to do the sources stuff
  - Optimise code (No more making 69 different classes per source)
  - Fix a bug with certain manga hosted on a different site (mangakakalot specific)
