# This project has been archived
On February 8, 2024, I decided to archive this project. When I started this project, I was somewhat new to Java and Android app development. Throughout my journey of developing Mangu, I learned a lot of new skills and had a lot of fun doing so. Sadly, all good things must come to an end. I have stopped enjoying working on this project for quite a while now. The main reason for this is that I don't want to continue constantly fixing bugs caused by API changes from the third-party sources the app uses. I recommend using an alternative to Mangu, as I am no longer going to be maintaining this project, and some of the API calls will inevitably break at some point.



# About Mangu


Mangu is an application that allows you to read manga from the internet.

I started this project as a way for me to learn more about app development in a fun way. I am still very inexperienced with app development.
